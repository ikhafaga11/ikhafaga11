I still remember the first time our family bought a computer back in **1998**. It came in boxes, and my parents spent hours reading the manual and putting it together. When the PC finally came to life, the whole family gathered in the living room, watching my dad explore **Paint** like it was magic. 🖌️✨


Fast forward to the early 2000s — **gaming ruled the era**. We connected via dial-up, clueless about which websites to explore, but every little discovery felt like an adventure. 🎮🌐

Eventually, each of my siblings—and I—got our own PCs. **MSN Messenger** and **Myspace** became our after-school hangouts. During this time, I became the family’s go-to “computer wizard,” solving problems with a simple restart or reconnect. Every success felt like casting a spell. 🧙‍♂️💻

Later, I stepped into **Technical Support**, and it felt like the stars aligned. I collaborated closely with experienced software engineers and got my first real taste of working in the tech world. ⭐

And now? Here I am 🙂 **designing applications**, building projects, and solving problems I once only dreamed about.

I’m passionate about **problem-solving, algorithms, system design, and data analytics**, and I feel like I’ve finally found my calling.

This is just the beginning of my journey — and I’m excited to share it with the world here on ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white). 🚀
